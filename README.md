# Insurance for a Cause

The website for **Insurance for a Cause**, the trade name of **Anchor Insurance
and Risk Management**, an independent agency in Grass Lake, Michigan.

Next.js App Router, TypeScript, plain CSS, deployed on Vercel. **Prospect, not
signed** as of August 2026: this is a concept build, and the pitch that goes with
it lives in this same repo under `public/pitch/`.

Read `glaze.md` in the `glazedweb` repo before touching this. The rules this
build follows are in `glaze/launch.md` (definition of done), `glaze/brand.md`
(the studio mark and credit), `glaze/intake.md` (the facts still missing) and
`glaze/proposal.md` (the host split).

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # localhost:3000
npm run build && npm start
```

**Audit the production build, never the dev server.** Dev serves different CSS
and hides build-time failures.

```bash
npm install axe-core playwright-core --no-save
npx next start -p 4502
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers \
  node ../glazedweb/glaze/scripts/audit.mjs --base http://127.0.0.1:4502 \

```

## Where content lives

**`lib/site.ts` is the one file.** Every business fact is there: the names, the
phone, the address, hours, license numbers, carriers, and the whole giving
program. A correction is one edit.

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `lib/site.ts` | Agency facts, contact, license, carriers, the giving program |
| `lib/pip.ts` | Michigan PIP levels and savings. **Source of truth for those numbers** |
| `lib/guides.ts` | The local explainer articles |

**The one surface that cannot read from `lib/site.ts`** is the pitch, at
`public/pitch/insuranceforacause/`. Those are hand-written static HTML on purpose
so they can be edited on a phone if a call goes sideways. If a fact changes
before she signs, it has to change in both places. After she signs the pitch gets
deleted and the problem goes away.

## Placeholders: what is not real yet

Everything below renders as a visibly marked blank rather than a guess. **Say
this out loud at handover.** A placeholder that ships silently reads to a visitor
as a real number, and that has already put invented prices in front of real
customers on another build.

- [ ] **Owner name** — `site.owner.name`. Also on the logo page in the pitch.
- [ ] **Amanda's role** — `site.owner.second`. We know she exists, not what she does.
- [ ] **Phone**, and the digits-only form for `tel:` links
- [ ] **Email**
- [ ] **Street address and ZIP**, and whether there is a walk-in office at all
- [ ] **Hours**, including the seasonal exception and the one day that is different
- [ ] **Michigan producer license number and NPN**
- [ ] **Carrier appointments** — `site.carriers` is an empty array and the homepage
      says so in words rather than showing a logo wall we are not entitled to
- [ ] **The giving percentage** — `giving.rate`. Never ship "a portion of proceeds"
- [ ] **First cause, target, deadline** — `giving.goal`
- [ ] **Her story** — `app/about/page.tsx`. Comes out of a recorded hour with her,
      in her words. The single most damaging thing on this site to invent
- [ ] **Privacy retention period** — `app/privacy/page.tsx`
- [ ] **Real photographs.** There are none. No stock, on purpose
- [ ] **The domain.** `site.url` assumes `insuranceforacause.com` and it is not
      bought. `site.urlConfirmed` is `false`. It feeds `metadataBase` and the
      sitemap, so it is load-bearing

---

## Traps

**The host split is in `beforeFiles` and has to stay there.** A plain `rewrites()`
array is `afterFiles`, which only runs once Next has failed to find a page, and
`app/page.tsx` already answers `/`. Put these in the wrong bucket and the pitch
host silently serves the client's homepage. Host scoping rather than
`basePath: "/demo"`, because basePath is global to a build and would bury the real
site under `/demo` the day the domain goes live.

**The quote form must keep working with JavaScript off, and that is not
automatic.** The first version shipped `hidden` on step two and `disabled` on the
submit, both rendered server-side, so a visitor without JS saw one step and could
never submit. Stepping now lives in a `.stepped` class the client adds after
mount, and `disabled` is gated on `ready`. **If you reintroduce `hidden={...}` on
a fieldset you break the no-JS path and nothing will tell you.** Test it:

```js
const ctx = await browser.newContext({ javaScriptEnabled: false });
```

**A hidden submit button is still the form's default button.** Enter from step one
submits unless the button is actually `disabled`. `hidden` alone does not stop it.

**`Reveal` re-arms on navigation.** `usePathname()` is in the dependency array on
purpose. Queried once on mount, it hides the next page's elements forever and
every internal link lands on a blank page while the URL and the nav highlight both
change correctly and nothing errors. A navigation test that does not assert
visibility will not catch it.

**`.reveal` only hides underneath `.js`.** The un-animated state is the finished
state. Move the opacity rule out from under that selector and a blocked script
ships a blank page.

**The mark has no `id` and no gradient, on purpose.** `components/Logo.tsx`
renders in both the header and the footer. A component that can render twice
cannot own a fixed id, and two instances sharing a gradient id has painted a dark
square before. Color comes from props, which is also how the reversed and
one-color versions work with no duplicated geometry.

**Two cuts, not one artwork at two sizes.** The rope hole closes into a smudge
below about 30px, so `Mark` switches to a solid heart under that width. The
favicon is built from the solid cut for the same reason.

**No `new Date()` in a rendered page.** It freezes at build time. That is why the
footer copyright has no year: a "dynamic" year that silently stops updating is
worse than no year.

**Three color tokens, each validated against BOTH light grounds.** `--brick` is a
fill color, white on it is 5.37. `--brick-ink` is red as *text*, because `--brick`
measures only 3.79 as text on `--sand`. `--slate` is 6.39 on paper and 4.99 on
sand. The sand band is a second ground and forgetting it is exactly how two
violations got in. **Fix contrast at the token, never on the flagged element.**

**The logo has to know where home is.** On a pitch host `/` is the proposal, not
the site, so a brand link pointing at `/` throws the client out of their own
site and back into the sales document. `components/HomeLink.tsx` resolves it
from the hostname, and **its host pattern must stay in sync with `PITCH_HOSTS`
in `next.config.ts`.** Every other link is fine, because `/coverage` and the
rest are not rewritten on that host and Next serves them normally. `/` is the
single path that means something different depending on where you are.

**Ticker rails have a hard width budget.** Mobile GPUs commonly stop
compositing a layer past 4096px and older ones at 2048. The rails were 4,510px
and 11,488px, which is why they sat still on a phone while animating fine in a
desktop browser. They are 3,421px and 3,693px now, measured at 390px wide, and
`lib/ticker.ts` says so. **Adding items to either rail spends that budget.**
Re-measure if you add any.

**Wide tables scroll inside themselves.** `.tablewrap` carries `tabIndex={0}` and a
`role`, because a scroll container is otherwise unreachable by keyboard.

---

## The quote form has no inbox yet

`app/api/quote/route.ts` **logs the full submission and always succeeds for the
visitor.** It does not pretend to deliver. There is a warning in the log on every
submission until `QUOTE_TO` is set.

This is the honest behavior when a form has no confirmed destination: accept it,
tell the visitor the truth, and write the whole payload to the log so nothing is
lost. What is not acceptable is a stub that waits half a second and says "Thanks,
we got it" while sending nowhere.

**To finish it:** set `QUOTE_TO` and the `SMTP_*` variables in the Vercel
dashboard, then implement `deliver()`. SMTP through a mailbox the agency already
owns, not a hosted API with its own subscription. If she has no mailbox yet, send
from a `glazedweb.com` address with `replyTo` set to the customer so her DNS work
is never on the critical path. See `.env.example`.

**PII.** The form deliberately does not ask for dates of birth, license numbers or
VINs. Those come up on the call. What it does collect is logged, not stored, and
`app/privacy/page.tsx` says so. **If the handler changes, that page changes with
it.**

## The giving program, and why it is shaped this way

Michigan DIFS publishes six conditions on a producer donating commission. Two are
load-bearing here:

- The donation must be **offered uniformly** and not tied to specific
  transactions. So the site never says "your policy bought X."
- The insured **must not control** which organization receives the donation. So
  the cause is picked by a **public vote open to anyone**, not by a
  choose-your-charity control on the quote form. Do not add one.

A third is operational: **the recipient must not be a client of the producer.**
That is published on the giving page and in the footer, because saying it out loud
is both good faith and compliance.

Her attorney or E&O carrier signs off on the program, not us. DIFS closes its own
FAQ recommending counsel.

## Done, measured against `glaze/launch.md`

The checklist below is that file's, copied here because launch.md says it is the
handover artifact rather than a private note. Ticked means measured, not assumed.

### Correctness

- [x] Zero accessibility violations at 390px and 1440px on every route. **21 routes, 0 violations.**
- [x] Zero console errors, zero 4xx, on every route.
- [x] `grep -rn PLACEHOLDER` returns only hits that are on the list above. **21, all in `lib/site.ts`.**
- [ ] **Every form actually submitted and confirmed arriving in a real inbox.** Not
      done and cannot be: there is no inbox yet. The handler logs the full payload
      and warns. See below.
- [x] Any remote data source verified on the deployment, not locally. **The market
      rail degrades to symbols with no prices if either upstream is down, so a
      failure is visible rather than silent. Re-check it on the deployment.**
- [x] Every heading, button and body run measured for contrast, not glanced at.

### The visitor's experience

- [x] Checked at 320, 390, 768 and 1440. Clean at all four.
- [x] Reduced motion produces a complete page. Rails stop, underline is fully
      drawn, both marks present, no reveal hidden.
- [x] With JavaScript off, every form still submits and every nav link still
      works. **7 of 7 header links reachable at 320, 390 and 1280.**
- [x] Keyboard: focus visible on every interactive element, skip link first in tab order.
- [x] LCP **1.03s** (bar 2.5s), CLS **0.0009** (bar 0.1), first-load JS **139KB
      gzipped** (bar 150KB). Measured on a throttled mobile profile: 4x CPU,
      1.6Mbps, 150ms latency.

### Search and sharing

- [x] Every route has its own title and meta description. No duplicates.
- [x] `og:image` absolute, on an origin that serves it, resolves 200 as an image.
- [x] Canonical points at the client's domain once `site.urlConfirmed` is true,
      and at the deployment host until then. Never at a host that answers nothing.
- [x] `InsuranceAgency` structured data on the homepage, a LocalBusiness subtype.
      **Address, phone and hours are omitted rather than filled with placeholders**,
      and appear automatically when the facts land in `lib/site.ts`.
- [x] `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` present, crawling allowed, pitch and preview
      hosts `noindex` by header.

### Security and handover

- [x] HTTPS enforced.
- [x] `npm audit --omit=dev`: **0 vulnerabilities.** Next is pinned at 16.3.1
      because 15.5.4 ships a published CVE and the only clean fix was Next 16.
- [x] No secret in the repo, in a commit, in a README, or in any file here.
- [x] Studio credit placed, plate ground computed with `plate.mjs`. **Telling the
      client it is there is still outstanding and is on the launch list below.**
- [x] README written: what it is, how to run it, where content lives, every trap
      named, decisions with reasoning, and this checklist.

### Faults this pass found

Reading `launch.md` properly turned up four things the earlier passes missed
entirely, and one of them was introduced by the fix for another.

**No structured data at all.** The Griffin Claw proposal makes "no `LocalBusiness`
schema anywhere" one of its findings, so shipping without it would have been us
charging for the thing we were doing.

**No canonical, and `metadataBase` pointed at a domain that does not exist.**
`insuranceforacause.com` is not bought, so every card and canonical resolved to a
host that answers nothing. `lib/url.ts` now resolves the real domain when
`site.urlConfirmed` is true and the deployment host until then, so it is correct
in both states and switches by itself.

**One reachable nav link at 390px with JavaScript off.** The burger was rendered
server-side and inert without React.

**CLS 0.3947, caused by the fix for the line above.** Rendering the mobile list
expanded and collapsing it on hydration shipped a header ~365px taller than it
ends up, so the whole page jumped upward when React arrived. It only appears on a
throttled connection, which is the profile a real phone has and a desktop test
does not. The mobile menu is now a native `<details>`: collapsed in the server's
HTML so nothing moves, open without JavaScript so every link is reachable.
**0.3947 to 0.0009.**

## The pitch, in this repo

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `public/pitch/insuranceforacause/index.html` | The proposal. Self-contained, no build step |
| `public/pitch/insuranceforacause/logo.html` | The logo presentation and mockups. **Send this first** |
| `public/pitch/insuranceforacause/og.jpg` | The proposal's link card, 1200x630 |
| `public/og.jpg` | The **demo's** link card. Hers, not Glazed's |
| `tools/og-card.html` | The proposal card is rendered from this |
| `tools/demo-og-card.html` | The demo card is rendered from this |

On `insuranceforacause.glazedweb.com`: proposal at `/`, logo at `/logo`, the whole
site at `/demo`. Every path on that host sends `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`,
and so does any `.vercel.app` host, which is indexable by default and the same
duplicate-content risk.

The proposal is priced **$3,500 build, $150 a month**, and it points at the demo
in six places: the hero button, a band at the top of "What we built", deep links
into `/demo/giving`, `/demo/quote` and `/demo/tools/michigan-pip`, and the
closing ask.

**The pitch host is matched by pattern, not by name: any `*.glazedweb.com`
subdomain, plus any `*.vercel.app` preview.** It started as the single literal
`insuranceforacause.glazedweb.com` and that was wrong twice. The subdomain
actually created was **`anchor.glazedweb.com`**, named for the repo rather than
the DBA, so nothing matched. And scoping to the custom domain alone left `/logo`
and `/demo` returning 404 on the preview URL, which is the host you open before
DNS is pointed. **On any pitch host the root is the proposal, not the site**; the
site is at `/demo`.

**`vercel.json` declares `framework: nextjs` and nulls `outputDirectory` on
purpose.** This repo began life as a static-only pitch with
`"outputDirectory": "public"`, and Vercel saved that into the *project settings*
when it was first imported. Dashboard settings survive deleting the file, so the
project kept serving `public/` as a flat directory: `next build` ran and
succeeded, `/pitch/insuranceforacause/index.html` returned 200, and every route
that needed the Next app returned Vercel&rsquo;s own `NOT_FOUND`. **A green build
proves nothing about what is being served.** `vercel.json` takes precedence over
project settings, which is what clears it from in here.

The research behind the content: the Michigan DIFS conditions, the eight-agency
survey of giving pages, the PIP and market research, and the discovery work on how
a new agency actually gets found in 2026. Ask Kevin.
